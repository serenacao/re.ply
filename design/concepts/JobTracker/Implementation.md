# implement: JobTracker

# prompt: refine it to raise errors instead of returning strings in the case of error.

# response:
# response:

Okay, I understand the prompt well:

1.  **Concept Design Principles:** I'll adhere to the guidelines for concept structure, independence, separation of concerns, and full functionality.
2.  **`JobTracker` Specification:** I will implement the `JobTracker` concept precisely as described in the provided `concept JobTracker` block.
3.  **`add` action focus:** I acknowledge the strong disagreement with a hypothetical previous `add` implementation and will pay close attention to its `requires` clause (uniqueness of `(position, company)` per `user`) and `effects` (creating a new job and returning its ID), as well as adhering to error handling conventions.
4.  **No `create`:** Confirming that the `add` action will handle creation, making a separate `create` action redundant for this concept's scope.
5.  **Implementation Details:** Using TypeScript, MongoDB, `ID` utility type, `freshID()`, returning `{}` for `Empty` results, and returning `{ error: "message" }` for "normal" errors.

# concept: JobTracker

*   **purpose:** keeps track of the jobs that the user has applied to, as well as the status (pending, rejected, accepted)
*   **principle:** when a user adds to the job tracker a job that they applied to, they can track it via updating the status from pending to accepted or rejected, or they can remove the job from the list
*   ## state:
    *   a set of Jobs
        *   a User
        *   a position of type String
        *   a company of type String
        *   a status of type String
*   actions:
    *   add(user: User, position: string, company: string, status: string): (Job)
        *   requires: the pairing position, company is unique under user
        *   effects: creates a new Job with position at company, with status, and adds it under user
    *   remove(user: User, job: Job): (Job)
        *   requires: job exists, user exists, and job exists under user.
        *   effects: removes job from set
    *   update(user: User, job: Job, position: string, company: string, status: string): (Job)
        *   requires: job exists, user exists, and job exists under user.
        *   effects: updates information of job to be position, company, and status

# response:

Okay, I understand. I will refine the `JobTracker` concept implementation to **throw errors** for all error conditions, rather than returning an object with an `error` property. This aligns with the specific prompt's instruction to "raise errors instead of returning strings in the case of error."

This means:
1.  All `return { error: "message" };` statements will be replaced with `throw new Error("message");`.
2.  The return types of the asynchronous action methods (`add`, `remove`, `update`) will be updated to reflect that they only return the successful result type (`{ job: Job }`) or throw an `Error`.
3.  JSDoc comments will be adjusted accordingly.
