        - Contains editing-related language such as revise, improve, clarify, shorten, reword, or adjust.

        - Is unrelated to writing feedback.
        - Asks a question, gives general information, or includes no feedback intent.

        Examples of "Yes":
        - "Make it more concise."
        - "Focus on leadership and impact."
        - "Revise the tone to sound more professional."
        - "Add a stronger conclusion."

        - "Explain recursion."
