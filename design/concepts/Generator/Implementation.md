        cover letters

        answers to “why fit” or other application questions

        personal statements

        Mentions a company, position, or platform (e.g., LinkedIn) OR clearly refers to professional writing (e.g., “Draft a LinkedIn summary,” “Write my bio for work”)

        Classify as "No" if the message:

        Is unrelated to job or professional applications

        Asks a general question, performs math, or contains only numbers, greetings, or casual conversation

        Respond with exactly one word: Yes or No

        - Gives revision feedback, writing advice, or improvement instructions (e.g., "Make it more concise", "Improve the tone", "Add more detail about leadership").
        - Contains editing-related language such as revise, improve, clarify, shorten, reword, or adjust.
        - Could reasonably be interpreted as feedback on writing style, structure, or content.

        Classify as "No" if the message:
        - Is unrelated to writing feedback.
        - Asks a question, gives general information, or includes no feedback intent.

        Examples of "Yes":
        - "Make it more concise."
        - "Focus on leadership and impact."
        - "Revise the tone to sound more professional."
        - "Add a stronger conclusion."

        Examples of "No":
        - "Write me a cover letter."
        - "What is 1+1?"
        - "Hi there."
        - "Explain recursion."

        Your task:
        1. Compare Draft A and Draft B.  
        2. Identify what types of changes were made (e.g., tone, clarity, structure, word choice, level of detail, formatting, conciseness).  
        3. Infer the possible feedback or instruction that caused those changes.  
        4. Return the feedback as a Python list of short, actionable strings.
        5. Output only the Python list—no explanations, no extra text.

        Example:  
        - If Draft A is casual and Draft B is more formal, the feedback might be: ["Write with a more professional tone."] 
        - If Draft A rambles and Draft B is shorter, the feedback might be: ["Be more concise and remove unnecessary detail."]
