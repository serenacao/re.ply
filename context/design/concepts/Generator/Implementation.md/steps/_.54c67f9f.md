* state
  * a question String
  * a draft String
  * an accepted Flag
  * a set of feedbackHistory String

* actions
  * updateInput(files: File\[]):
    * effect: updates files used to generate draft

  * async generate(question: String, llm: LLM, files: File\[]): (draft: String)
    * requires question is a valid question
    * effects generate a draft to the question using the files provided with accepted FALSE

  * accept(): (draft: String)
    * requires question to exist and draft status is not accepted
    * effects set draft status to accepted

  * edit(llm: LLM, newDraft: String):
    * requires draft status is not accepted, draft already exists
    * effects replaces current draft with newDraft, adds to feedback history

  * async feedback(llm: LLM, feedback: string): (draft: String)
    * requires feedback to be a valid feedback for a draft, draft has not yet been accepted
    * effects adds to feedback history, generate new text with updated content based off all feedback so far and current files
