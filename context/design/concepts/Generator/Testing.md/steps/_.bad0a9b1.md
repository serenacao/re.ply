# concept Generator

* **purpose**: an interactive answer that can be generated and modified by an LLM and modified, accepted, and copied by a user through feedback

* **principle**: after the LLM generates answertype to the question, if there is user feedback, it will regenerate its output. Otherwise, the user can edit it or copy it for their use.

* state
  * a question String
  * a draft String
  * an accepted Flag
  * a set of feedbackHistory String

* actions
  * updateInput(files: File\[]):
    * effect: updates files used to generate draft

  * async generate(question: String, llm: LLM, files: File\[]): (draft: String)
    * requires question is a valid question
    * effects generate a draft to the question using the files provided with accepted FALSE

  * accept(): (draft: String)
    * requires question to exist and draft status is not accepted
    * effects set draft status to accepted

  * edit(llm: LLM, newDraft: String):
    * requires draft status is not accepted, draft already exists
    * effects replaces current draft with newDraft, adds to feedback history

  * async feedback(llm: LLM, feedback: string): (draft: String)
    * requires feedback to be a valid feedback for a draft, draft has not yet been accepted
    * effects adds to feedback history, generate new text with updated content based off all feedback so far and current files

        - Contains editing-related language such as revise, improve, clarify, shorten, reword, or adjust.

        - Is unrelated to writing feedback.
        - Asks a question, gives general information, or includes no feedback intent.

        Examples of "Yes":
        - "Make it more concise."
        - "Focus on leadership and impact."
        - "Revise the tone to sound more professional."
        - "Add a stronger conclusion."

        - "Hi there."
        - "Explain recursion."
