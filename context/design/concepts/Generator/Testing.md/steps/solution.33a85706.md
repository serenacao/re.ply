# solution: Re-implement Generator as a Concept-Compliant Class

To resolve the identified problems and align the `Generator` functionality with the concept design principles and implementation guidelines, it must be re-implemented as a proper Concept class.

The key changes involve:

1. **MongoDB for State Persistence**:
   * Defining explicit interfaces (`QuestionDoc`, `FeedbackDoc`) for the concept's state elements, mapping directly to MongoDB documents.
   * Using `Collection<T>` properties (`questions`, `feedbackHistory`) within the class, initialized in the constructor via the injected `Db` instance.
   * All actions will now interact with these MongoDB collections (insert, find, update, delete) to manage state, ensuring persistence.
   * The `ID` type is used for document `_id` fields, adhering to the prescribed pattern.

2. **`Db` Dependency Injection**: The class constructor now correctly accepts a `Db` instance, allowing the concept to connect to the database.

3. **Action Signature Conformance**:
   * All action methods (`generate`, `accept`, `edit`, `feedback`) are updated to accept a single dictionary/JSON object as an argument and return a single dictionary/JSON object (e.g., `{ draft: string }` for success or `{ error: string }` for failure).
   * The `Empty` type is used for actions that do not return specific data upon successful completion.

4. **Handling `LLM`**: The `LLM` (`GeminiLLM`) is still passed as a runtime argument to actions, assuming it's an external service. Its interaction is contained within the concept's logic.

5. **`updateInput`**: The `updateInput` action is still omitted from the re-implementation. I'm inferring from the original TS class that `files` are transient and only provided during the `generate` action, rather than being a persistent part of the concept's state. If `files` were meant to be persistent, a dedicated collection for them and an `updateInput` action managing that collection would be necessary.

6. **Precondition/Effect Enforcement**: The `requires` conditions are explicitly checked at the beginning of action methods, returning an `{ error: string }` if not met. The `effects` are translated into precise MongoDB operations that update the concept's persistent state.

7. **`@utils/types.ts` and `@utils/database.ts`**: These helper utilities are now correctly used for `ID` types, `Empty` returns, and `freshID` generation. Query methods (`_getDraft`, `_getFeedbackHistory`, `_getAcceptedStatus`) are added for state verification, returning arrays of dictionaries as per guidelines.

This re-implementation brings the `Generator` class into full compliance with the concept design paradigm, ready for robust testing within the specified framework.
