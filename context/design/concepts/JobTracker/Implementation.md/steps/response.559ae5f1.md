# response:

Here's the implementation of the `JobTracker` concept following your guidelines, including the specific instruction to raise errors with promises rather than returning error objects, and a detailed explanation of the `add` action's ambiguity and resolution.

### `# concept: JobTracker`

* **purpose:** keeps track of the jobs that the user has applied to, as well as the status (pending, rejected, accepted)
* **principle:** when a user adds to the job tracker a job that they applied to, they can track it via updating the status from pending to accepted or rejected, or they can remove the job from the list
* ## state:
  * a set of Jobs
    * a User
    * a position of type String
    * a company of type String
    * a status of type String
* actions:
  * create(user: User, position: string, company: string, status: string): (Job)
    * effects: creates a new Job with position at company, with status, under user
  * remove(user: User, job: Job): (Job)
    * requires: job exists, user exists, and job exists under user.
    * effects: removes job from set
  * add(user: User, job: Job): (Job)
    * requires: user exists, job does not already exist under user
    * effects: adds job to set
  * update(user: User, job: Job, position: string, company: string, status: string): (Job)
    * requires: job exists, user exists, and job exists under user.
    * effects: updates information of job to be position, company, and status

### `# problem:`

The specification for the `add` action in the `JobTracker` concept was originally provided as `add(user: User, job: Job): (Job)`. The confusion arises because this signature only takes `user` (the tracker) and `job` (an ID) as arguments. However, the `Job` type in the concept's state explicitly requires `position`, `company`, and `status` fields to form a complete `JobDocument`.

If `add` were implemented strictly with only `user` and `job: Job` as input:

1. **Violation of "Completeness of functionality":** The `JobTracker` concept is defined to "keep track of jobs," which implies managing all their necessary details. If `add` could not receive `position`, `company`, and `status` directly, the concept would not be self-sufficient for defining a complete job entry. It would implicitly rely on some external mechanism or another concept to provide these essential details for the given `Job` ID, thereby breaking its independence.
2. **Data Integrity Issues:** Creating a `JobDocument` in the database without `position`, `company`, or `status` would result in an incomplete record. This would lead to potential runtime errors or logical inconsistencies in parts of the application that expect these fields to always be present.

### `# solution:`

To address this ambiguity and strictly adhere to the "Completeness of functionality" principle—which states that concepts are complete with respect to their functionality and don't rely on functionality from other concepts for their core behavior—the `add` action has been implemented to accept the full job details (`position`, `company`, `status`) as arguments, in addition to `user` and the `job` ID.

The key distinction for this `add` action (compared to the `create` action) is that it allows the caller to *provide* the `Job`'s ID (`job: Job`), whereas `create` generates a new unique ID internally using `freshID()`. This makes `add` suitable for scenarios where a job application might already have a pre-existing identifier (e.g., when importing data from an external system, or re-adding a job that was tracked elsewhere).

The modified signature for `add` used in the implementation is:
`async add({ user, job: jobId, position, company, status }: { user: User; job: Job; position: string; company: string; status: string }): Promise<{ job: Job }>`

This revised signature ensures that any job added via this action will always have all necessary information as defined by the concept's state, making the `JobTracker` concept truly complete and independent for managing job applications.

***

**Note on Error Handling:**

As per your explicit instruction in the prompt: "please do not return error strings, but rather raise errors with the promises," this implementation uses `throw new Error(...)` for all exceptional conditions (such as validation failures or database errors). This means that callers of these methods should wrap their calls in `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors gracefully. This approach deviates from the general "Error handling" section in the provided documentation, which suggested returning an `{ error: string }` object for non-exceptional failures. For this response, the prompt's specific instruction was prioritized.
