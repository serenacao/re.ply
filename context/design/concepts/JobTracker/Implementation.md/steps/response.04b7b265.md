# response:

Okay, I understand the prompt well:

1. **Concept Design Principles:** I'll adhere to the guidelines for concept structure, independence, separation of concerns, and full functionality.
2. **`JobTracker` Specification:** I will implement the `JobTracker` concept precisely as described in the provided `concept JobTracker` block.
3. **`add` action focus:** I acknowledge the strong disagreement with a hypothetical previous `add` implementation and will pay close attention to its `requires` clause (uniqueness of `(position, company)` per `user`) and `effects` (creating a new job and returning its ID), as well as adhering to error handling conventions.
4. **No `create`:** Confirming that the `add` action will handle creation, making a separate `create` action redundant for this concept's scope.
5. **Implementation Details:** Using TypeScript, MongoDB, `ID` utility type, `freshID()`, returning `{}` for `Empty` results, and returning `{ error: "message" }` for "normal" errors.
