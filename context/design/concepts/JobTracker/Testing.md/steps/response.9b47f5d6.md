# response:

Okay, I understand. I will refine the `JobTracker` concept implementation to **throw errors** for all error conditions, rather than returning an object with an `error` property. This aligns with the specific prompt's instruction to "raise errors instead of returning strings in the case of error."

This means:

1. All `return { error: "message" };` statements will be replaced with `throw new Error("message");`.
2. The return types of the asynchronous action methods (`add`, `remove`, `update`) will be updated to reflect that they only return the successful result type (`{ job: Job }`) or throw an `Error`.
3. JSDoc comments will be adjusted accordingly.
