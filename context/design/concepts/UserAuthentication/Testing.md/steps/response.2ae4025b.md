```trace
1. `register({ username: "alice", password: "password123" })`
   - Expected outcome: Returns `{ user: "user:id_for_alice" }`. A new user record for "alice" with the specified password and a generated ID is stored in the `UserAuthentication.users` collection. This fulfills the `effects` of the `register` action.

2. `authenticate({ username: "alice", password: "password123" })`
   - Expected outcome: Returns `{ user: "user:id_for_alice" }`. The system successfully finds the user "alice" by matching both username and password, and returns her ID. This fulfills the `effects` of the `authenticate` action and also confirms that the `requires` condition (user with username and password exists) is met.

This trace demonstrates the principle that "after a user registers with a username and a password, they can authenticate with that same username and password and be treated each time as the same user," as the ID returned by `authenticate` matches the ID generated during `register`.
```
