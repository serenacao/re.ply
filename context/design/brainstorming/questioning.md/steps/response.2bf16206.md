# response:

The question "Why...?" is a fantastic and fundamental one, but it's incomplete!

To give you a meaningful answer, I need to know *what* you're asking "Why?" about. The "why" can apply to virtually anything:

* **Why** do things fall to the ground? (Physics)
* **Why** is that person happy? (Psychology/Observation)
* **Why** did the stock market crash? (Economics/History)
* **Why** did you make that suggestion? (My own programming/data processing)
* **Why** does water boil at 100 degrees Celsius? (Chemistry)

Please complete your question by telling me the specific subject, event, phenomenon, or statement you're curious about, and I'll do my best to explain the reasons behind it!
